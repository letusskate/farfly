# FarFly

---

Due to being very busy recently, the code is still being organized and has not been uploaded yet.

Code will be coming soon, before April 10, 2026.

This project will definitely be open-sourced eventually. Stay tuned!

Our previous code repository CARDS is already open-source. Feel free to check it out:
